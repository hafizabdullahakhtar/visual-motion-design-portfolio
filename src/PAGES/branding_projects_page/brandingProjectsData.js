      "As part of a high-impact 10-day brand sprint, I had the privilege of contributing to the launch of Blockaid, a cutting-edge blockchain security platform on a mission to make crypto ownership seamless and secure for everyone. Blockaid is not just a company—it's a vision for a safer, more trustworthy world of blockchain transactions. The company aims to empower everyday users to confidently navigate the crypto world, and I was honored to play a crucial role in shaping the brand's visual identity and social presence. A significant portion of my work involved designing and animating social media assets to build Blockaid's online presence. These assets were designed to engage and inform potential customers, driving excitement around the platform. However, due to an NDA, I am unable to showcase these specific works, but I can confirm they were integral in the success of the project. This wasn’t just another branding project. The speed and intensity of the 10-day sprint required agile thinking, creative excellence, and the ability to produce high-quality work under tight deadlines.",
